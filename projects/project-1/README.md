## Project 1

### Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to be able to access data from different sources, combine them into a database, and query the database to get relative information for the stakeholders

#### Part 1
Using the provided BRD and API documentation, you will need to create a table that will hold the data that you retrieve from the API in your postgres database. 


### Part 2
Given the dataset `client_contact_status.csv`, you will now create an ER Diagram that connects this dataset to the previous data you have already stored in the postgres database. Keep in mind the normal forms when creating the tables. 

You need to then process the csv data and load that data into your database. 

### Part 3
You will create an excel spreadsheet that meets the business requirements given in the BRD

### Stretch Goal
You will come up with a way to validate the data.  In the real world you will be dealing with many types of sensative data that if it is changed can cause errors that may cost the company money.  How would you verify that the data coming from the API / CSV is the same data that you put in the databse? 

### Presentation
You will create a slide deck covering the following points: 
- Talk about Architectural Decisions
- Talk about any challenges you had to overcome.
- Talk about anything that you would do differently
- Address anything that you tried, but could not get to work, if anything.
