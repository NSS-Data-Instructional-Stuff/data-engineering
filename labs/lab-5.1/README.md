## Lab 5.1

### Introduction
We will have a session to elicit requirements. This will be your first session to learn how to gather requirements for a project.  Sometimes the customer knows
exactly what they want, and sometimes they do not. Sometimes they think they know, but really need something different. Your job is to learn how to ask the right questions to make them think about what it is they need. We will learn what is worth asking upfront, and what should wait until the first iteration. 
Here are some considerations: 
- How to agree on an MVP.
- How to agree on the definition of done
- How to communicate technical things to a non technical audience. 

Use those requirements to design a small application that reads from an api and returns data as a csv
Design only no implementation. 
Be ready to defend your architectural choices.
