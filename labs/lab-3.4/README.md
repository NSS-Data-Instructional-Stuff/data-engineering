## Lab 3.4

### Introduction
This lab will start to prepare you to build data pipelines. Serverless technology can be scaled on demand, is cheaper in most instances than managing a VM or on prem solution, and is an integral part of data pipelines. You will create two cloud functions,  one in Azure and one in GCP.  You only need to run these locally, and do not have to publish these to the cloud, unless you have time and want to attempt.  You will be given the `starwars.xlsx` file and will need to read it into memory and then save it as a csv. 

### Part 1
Create a local azure function that transforms the given data set into a .csv

### Part 2
create a local gcp function that transforms the given data set into a csv
