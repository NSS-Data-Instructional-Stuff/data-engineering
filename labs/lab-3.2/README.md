## Lab 3.2

### Introduction
In this lab you will take the data from the postgres database that you added data to in lab 3.1 and restructure it to work with a document database.  You have been given a docker compose file for a mongo db instance. 

Using the VS code extension verify that you can connect to the database locally after starting the container. Then write a python script to get the data from postgres, reformat it, and then write it to the mongodb instance.
