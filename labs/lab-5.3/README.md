## Lab 5.3

### Introduction
One of the things that makes a great engineer is not how well they can code, but that they become a little better everyday. We have covered a lot of topics in this class, and you have learned what 'good' code looks like, it is time to look back at old code you wrote in this class. 

### Part 1
Go through old labs and find examples of code that could be improved, and then suggest the improvement that you would make.  Go ahead and re-write the code, however make sure to save a copy of the old code as you will need both versions for part 2. 

### Part 2
We will have a round table discussion with everyone presenting the piece of code that they would refactor. The instructor will also participate and present a piece of their code and the changes that they made to it.
