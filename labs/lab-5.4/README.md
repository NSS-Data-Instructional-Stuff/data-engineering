## Lab 5.4

### Introduction
We are going to prepare data for the Data Scientists so that they can perform their analysis. They would like a table that has the count of trips and total distance traveled, by company and by day, for the month of May. 

### Instructions
Configure a data pipeline using dbt (written in plain SQL) and the `may_trip.parquet` [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11qJVg5li8QBc03kyHDnsuNNcYgoXoe8R/view?usp=drive_link). Process the data and put the required results in DuckDB.  Write a Python function that queries DuckDB and verifies you have the data that is needed.
