## Lab 6.1

### Introduction
Now that you have completed our lesson on Airflow, you are going to put that knowledge to use. Sometimes in industry a new technology comes out that solves some of the problems of the old technology. Security, developer experience, and speed are some of the reasons why you would want to adopt a new technology. 

### Instructions
Take the pipeline that you made in Lab 5.5, and reproduce it using arflow. You will still use DuckDB and you will want to verify the data with Python in the end to make sure it still meets the requirements.
