### Lab 2.1 

### Introduction
You have given a business requirements document (BRD) for a new fudge shop that is about to open. The BRD has laid out what will be required for the creation of custom software for their point of sale. **You** are in charge of creating the data model for this project. Use the BRD as a guide to create a data model that aligns with the software that will be developed. 

#### PART 1
Read the BRD: `Daniel's Fudge Shop BRD.pdf`
- Create an ER Diagram
- Show the different relationships for the data (1:1 , 1:many, many:many)
- Take into account the different normal forms when creating the tables to avoid data duplication
