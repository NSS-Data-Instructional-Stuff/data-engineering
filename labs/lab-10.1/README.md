## Lab 10.1  (Need a dataset)

### Introduction
Up to this point you have delivered data to the end user in file or database format. This is a valid way to deliver data in a lot of instances, however security in these cases can be a concern. If you are sending propriatary data via a csv, the csv has to be passed around from the tech team to the business team, to possibly an outside tech team to consume the data at a different company. This is common practice, but may not always be ideal. A different approach to this is to set up an API for the outside tech team to authenticate against and get the data that you want them to have. They will do this programatically, and usually will automate it, and then create the reports that are needed on their end. This allows you to limit authentication, authorization, rate limits and format of the data as needed. In this lab you will create an api in python, and test it using Postman.  

### Part 1
You will need to spin up a postgres database with the following data (TBD) 

### Part 2
You will connect python to the database. 

### Part 3
You will create the following endpoints: 

GET  (TBD Based on dataset) 
POST (TBD Based on dataset)
PUT  (TBD Based on dataset)
DELETE (TBD Based on dataset)
