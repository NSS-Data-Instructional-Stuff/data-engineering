## Lab 3.1

### Introduction
In this lab you will insert data into the postgres database that you created in project 1. 

You should currently have two tables, once you created for the api data and one that you created for the csv data.  You will insert more data into the table that you created for the csv data, using an `INSERT SELECT` to add multiple records, while matching the id's that are currently in the table you created for the API Data. 

You will also want to proactice updating records,  so pick a few records in the table that you made for csv data and change the company to "NSS"
